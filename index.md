  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Recent progress in foundation models has transformed many areas of machine learning,
    yet their application to brain data remains in its infancy. The complexity, diversity,
    and multimodal nature of neuroimaging present unique challenges and opportunities
    for building general-purpose models of the brain.
  </p>
  <p>
    This workshop brings together researchers from neuroscience, machine learning,
    and clinical disciplines to advance brain foundation models—large-scale, pre-trained models
    that learn meaningful representations of brain anatomy and function.
